MongoDB makes use of records which are made up of documents that contain a data structure composed of field and value pairs. 
Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. The documents are similar to JavaScript Object Notation(JSON), but use a variant called Binary JSON (BSON). 
The benefit of using BSON is that it accommodates more data types.
The fields in these documents are similar to the columns in a relational database. 
Values contained can be a variety of data types, including other documents, arrays and arrays of documents, according to the MongoDB user manual. 
Documents will also incorporate a primary key as a unique identifier.
